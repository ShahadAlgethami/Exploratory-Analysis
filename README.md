## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project
I was interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand:</br>
1. What are the most used programming languages in United States </br>
2. What are the most wanted programming languages in United States? </br>
3. How does programming languages used at work relates with programming languages people want to learn? </br>
